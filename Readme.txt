Procedure to test output
 
1.Download the arduino software.
2.Copy the code that we attached into a newfile in arduino software.
3.Now include the required libraries through sketch option in menu bar.
4.After including required libraries compile the code before dumping it into the NODEMCU.
5.If there are any errors in the code correct them.(the code we attached will not have any errors)
6.Now connect nodemcu to cpu.
7.Use usb cable to connect nodemcu to pc.
8.Now dump the code into the nodemcu.
9.While dumping is going on open blynk app in your mobile add new project, name the project and setup
  the dashboard as required.
10.Once the dumping of code into nodemcu is done. connect the sensors and motor to the nodemcu.
11.Use 5volt output adapter to power nodemcu.
12.Use 12volt adapter for motor driver.
13.After connecting the hardware components observe whether the motor is woriking or not when there is 
   no flow of liquid through flow sensor.
